# docker_app

I have created a beautiful app, which will run the linux command through the app also it will the result of the command in the app.
The app contains the textfield where we will enter the commands of the linux and when we click on the submit button it will display the output of the result in the app.
The app will also run the docker command such as docker run -dit --name osname centos:7. we can create the os through this app in the docker and also we can do some operation in docker.
